"2990","8050"," Hi everyone, my name is Sarah Kane. I'm a PhD student in astronomy at the"
"8050","13710"," University of Cambridge and I am one of the co-instructors for this non-visual"
"13710","19150"," data science tutorial series alongside Patrick Smith who is a blind programmer"
"19150","23270"," and programming instructor and consultant with the Iota School. This is"
"23270","28550"," the fourth of the five tutorial series. Today we'll begin talking about data"
"28550","33570"," sonification and the next tutorial, next week, will also cover the same topic."
"33930","39190"," Again these tutorials take place Tuesdays from 6 to 8 p.m. UK time, that's my time"
"39190","45710"," zone, 1 to 3 p.m. Eastern Time in the US or whatever that corresponds to in your"
"45710","51330"," respective time zone. These tutorials are being very generously supported by Pandas"
"51330","56490"," and Numfocus which makes them free and available to all of you and all of the"
"57210","61730"," recording you're watching right now and all of the written curricula are online"
"61730","65750"," and available to you. I really encourage you to check out the curriculum, it's got"
"65750","70170"," all of the code we'll go over as well as some more details and you know written"
"70170","73510"," instructions for everything we're doing today if you want to revisit it in"
"73510","76870"," written form and of course Patrick and I are always happy to answer your"
"76870","82710"," questions over email. We also have office hours on Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. UK"
"82710","88590"," time, 1 to 3 p.m. Eastern Time in the US and so on and so forth over the same"
"88590","93270"," zoom link that this live tutorial occurs. Now those of you who are watching this"
"93270","98250"," right now might be able to tell that this is not a live zoom course happening. "
"98710","103410"," We're currently, well I, this is not the Royal We, but I am currently re-recording"
"103410","109530"," this tutorial. We had some unfortunate sound difficulties during the live zoom"
"109530","113690"," so we wanted to make sure there was a nice clean version with no sound"
"113690","119030"," difficulties available to everyone for posterity so to speak. So I'm excited to"
"119030","122530"," go over this curriculum again with all of you and again if you have questions"
"122530","128070"," please feel free to reach out. Now without further ado, especially because"
"128070","132810"," there's no one else here with me, I think we're just going to jump right into"
"132810","139510"," things. So as you have before I encourage you now to open up Anaconda prompt. I'm"
"139510","143730"," already on the screen, I'm going to turn on my NVDA speech again, didn't want it"
"143730","148650"," talking over me during the intro. Speech mode beeps, speech mode talk. Excellent"
"148650","155850"," and hopefully you can hear that okay. Okay so open up Anaconda prompt as we"
"155850","160050"," have in the previous three tutorials. If you are not already there like I am you"
"160050","164990"," can do that by hitting the Windows key and typing in Anaconda prompt to open it"
"164990","170110"," up. Again this is Anaconda prompt not Anaconda navigator and what I want you"
"170110","176510"," to do right now is not to start IPython. Again please do not start IPython yet"
"176510","181790"," which is what we do usually after opening Anaconda prompt because"
"181790","186870"," that's the sort of interactive workspace we have to write code and test it. But"
"186870","191130"," what we're actually about to do right now is to do something called installing"
"191130","197590"," a package. Now we've used packages in the previous tutorials. We've used pandas and"
"197590","202150"," NumPy. These are like libraries of code that other people have written that we"
"202150","206590"," can now make use of and those packages because they're really popular and"
"206590","211970"," widely used are available with the Anaconda installation that you already"
"211970","217910"," have. But some less common packages like Astronify which is the sonification"
"217910","223450"," package that we're going to use today is not already pre-installed with Anaconda."
"223890","228030"," So we're gonna have to install it ourselves. No worries it's a pretty"
"228030","232510"," simple. It's as simple as one line of code actually. But before we get into that I"
"232510","238470"," want to just go over a few caveats. First of all unfortunately to our knowledge we"
"238470","243670"," really only expect the Astronify installation to work properly on Windows"
"243670","249970"," computers and also maybe on older MacBooks. If you have a MacBook with one"
"249970","256630"," of the newer Mac chips so not an Intel chip but a Mac chip so that's the M1, M2,"
"257029","262270"," M3 Mac we have had no luck getting Astronify to work on those new Macs."
"262770","268650"," Likewise if you are a Linux person using Linux unfortunately we also have not had"
"268650","273390"," luck getting Astronify to work on Linux. This alongside our desire to use"
"273390","277390"," NVDA as the screen reader we're teaching with is kind of one of the"
"277390","281870"," motivations for us encouraging all of you to use Windows for this tutorial"
"281870","289630"," series. Also if you have other packages already installed so say you already"
"289630","294370"," program a bunch and have other things installed on your Anaconda it is"
"294370","299310"," possible that this might not work. It's really hard to predict how different"
"299310","303150"," package dependencies might not get along with each other, might not work out"
"303150","308250"," properly. So if you have some sort of error message because you have other"
"308250","312430"," packages already installed please do let Patrick and I know either in office"
"312430","317270"," hours or over email and we will try to help you out. But for the vast majority"
"317270","322130"," of you who have installed Anaconda nice and fresh for this course this should be"
"322130","328090"," quite simple. We hope anyway. Cross your fingers. So installing Astronify and"
"328090","332310"," I've uninstalled it actually so that I can install it with you now is as simple"
"332310","337510"," as one line that we're going to type again not in IPython just in the Anaconda"
"337510","345850"," prompt. We are going to type PIP. PIP is our package manager here. It's the"
"345850","350350"," one managing all these libraries of code. PIP is the thing that's going to install"
"350350","354270"," this package for us. There's another package manager out there called Conda."
"354690","358690"," Some things are available via Conda others via PIP. We won't get into that. "
"358690","362850"," This one we're going to use PIP and if you're curious check out the curriculum"
"362850","369530"," online where I talk about it a little bit more. So it's PIP P-I-P space space"
"370390","385290"," install ""I-N-S-T-A-L-L"" PIP space install space Astronify ""space A-S-T-R-O-N"

"415260","419680"," that now because there's a lot of text happening there. So I don't want you to"
"419680","423140"," hear all of it but I wanted some of it to play because I don't want you to feel"
"423140","428340"," like alarmed when NVDA starts reading out just this absolute barrage of text."
"428520","432820"," It should mostly be along the lines of like requirement already satisfied you"

"437520","442400"," like you know couldn't do this or whatnot that's a good time to start"
"442400","447480"," maybe doing some googling or contacting Patrick and I but hopefully it'll all"
"447480","451820"," be nice things that are like requirement already satisfied and it should end with"
"451820","456100"," successfully installed Astronify and that should be all you need to do."
"457180","461220"," Occasionally I think I've seen some people get a message where it says"
"461220","467760"," proceed question mark yes why slash no and you have to hit type Y for yes and"
"467760","472320"," then hit enter. I don't think most of you should get that but if you do not"
"472320","480920"," worry. And with that congratulations the Astronify package is installed cool done."
"481280","486640"," First module or first section of this curriculum or this tutorial is checked"
"486640","491860"," off the list. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to actually step away from the"
"491860","496100"," terminal step away from some code and give you a little bit more theory about"
"496100","500880"," what sonification is and how it works. Now I've just mentioned sonification a"
"500880","505500"," bunch of times here without actually saying anything about what it is so"
"505500","508480"," we're gonna get into the theory we're gonna get into the examples and then"
"508480","519360"," we'll get back to the code yeah. On that note I'm going to turn off the"
"519360","523960"," speech for NVDA so it doesn't decide it wants to talk over me or talk over any"
"523960","528460"," of the sonification examples which we did have a little bit of in the original"
"528460","534240"," zoom so you know this is one a sound issue we will dodge. Speech mode off. "
"534500","541520"," All right and with that we will get into what is this sonification thing. So in the"
"541520","549620"," simplest terms sonification is the representation of data via sound. This is"
"549620","555440"," directly analogous to data visualization where data is represented via some"
"555440","560720"," visual medium. These are your line charts your bar charts your pie charts"
"560720","564860"," your histograms the list goes on there are a ton of data visualizations out"
"564860","570560"," there. Importantly the data does not literally look this way it does not"
"570560","574360"," literally look like a line graph it doesn't look like a bar chart this is"
"574360","579920"," how we choose often to represent it through some visual medium. In fact"
"579920","584780"," there are a lot of arbitrary choices involved in these in these visualizations"
"584780","590020"," for instance you have a line chart how are you going to scale the axes how"
"590020","594160"," large will you make the points these are all various different choices that you"
"594160","600940"," can make in these data visualizations. It is a representation of the data a way we"
"600940","605680"," choose often to picture the data and oftentimes they're quite useful they let"
"605680","610000"," us understand trends and things like that but there are issues with data"
"610000","614600"," visualizations and not the least of which which will be of course great"
"614600","618540"," interest to me and you is that they're not accessible to people with visual"
"618540","624400"," impairments like me. So data sonification where we represent the"
"624400","630660"," data as sound sort of corrects or steps around that one that sort of problem. Now"
"630660","635460"," before we get more into data sonification and what exactly a"
"635460","640860"," sonification could be besides the sound representation of data I want to break"
"640860","646400"," down some common misconceptions about sonification. First of all sonification"
"646400","652680"," generally doesn't involve words so it's like non-speech audio so for instance me"
"652680","657600"," standing here and telling you about data for instance when Patrick told you about"
"657600","663160"," the Airbnb data set that is not a sonification it's just him telling you"
"663160","667340"," about the about the data so it's not typically what we'd consider a"
"667340","672460"," sonification a sound representation of the data it's like a word representation"
"672460","675960"," of the data something along the lines of that I don't have a more elegant word"
"675960","680860"," for that but it's not generally what we'd consider sonification. Sonification"
"680860","687420"," also is not what we consider like natural sounds or or just the sounds"
"687420","692780"," themselves. What do I mean by this? Well for instance imagine you have someone"
"692780","698580"," walking and you are listening to their footsteps to understand to measure how"
"698580","704780"," quickly they are walking. In this case the sound of their footsteps is not a"
"704780","710840"," sonification. The sound of their footsteps is the data so the sound is"
"710840","717020"," not a representation of the data the sound in that case is the data. Scott"
"717020","720520"," Fleming in his talk at the Space Telescope Science Institute's Day of"
"720520","726220"," Accessibility had another great example bird songs not a sonification bird songs"
"726220","731180"," would be your data if you were going out and observing bird songs same sort of"
"731180","736540"," idea here. So it is in the same way that a data visualization is not literally"
"736540","742020"," like what the data looks like a data sonification is not literally what the"
"742020","748920"," data sounds like. Alright so we've broken down roughly what sonification is it's"
"748920","754220"," a sound representation of the data and it's not words and it's not sounds from"
"754220","759680"," nature. Okay we've got the big picture here the only way to concretize this"
"759680","765020"," sort of idea of what sonification is is going to be to get into how we actually"
"765020","770100"," sonify things. Today we're going to go over two of the most common sonification"
"770100","775300"," techniques this is going to be modification and parameter mapping what"
"775300","780200"," they are what their differences are and we'll also talk about some or we'll also"
"780200","787950"," show some examples of each. Alright let's begin by talking about"
"787950","793190"," modification. You'll often hear modification described as the most"
"793190","800230"," direct mapping the most direct representation of data as sound. What do"
"800230","807630"," we mean by this? Well suppose we have two variables here X and Y and in this case"
"807630","814490"," Y is our dependent variable which means that as X changes Y changes in response."
"815270","821530"," Now for our purposes here I'm going to say X is time so as time goes on Y"
"821530","828550"," changes with time and so if Y is varying with time going up and down as time goes"
"828550","834110"," by you can kind of imagine Y moving like in a regular wave not like a smooth wave"
"834110","840470"," pattern but it's going up and down so Y the height of the wave is changing with"
"840470","847490"," time. Now we call the height of a wave the amplitude and just as this height"
"847490","853750"," this amplitude of Y is changing with time we can imagine the amplitude of a"
"853750","860570"," sound wave changing with time at the same sort of way. So basically if Y goes"
"860570","867750"," up the amplitude the height of our sound wave goes up and if Y goes down the"
"867750","873930"," amplitude or height of our sound wave goes down. So we are mapping the height"
"873930","880530"," of Y to the height of the sound wave. This is what we mean by direct mapping"
"880530","885830"," we're treating Y like it's a wave and then just making the sound wave that"
"885830","892030"," represents Y behave in the exact same way as Y in terms of how it goes up and"
"892030","898910"," down. Now our ears perceive amplitude the height of the sound wave and again sound"
"898910","905670"," is a wave in the air so our ears perceive the amplitude of a sound wave as the"
"905670","909550"," volume it has to do with like this air pressure essentially you'll hear it as"
"909550","916010"," changes in volume and so essentially what is happening is by going up and"
"916010","922650"," down Y is controlling the value ofhsorry the volume of the sound wave we"
"922650","931170"," hear representing the data. Alright so we've covered how the volume is"
"931170","937590"," controlled by Y. What about pitch that's another really important part of sound"
"937590","943090"," how high or low of note is. Well this comes down to something we call data"
"943090","948230"," sampling. We don't measure data continuously rather we have some sampling"
"948230","953330"," rate which is often how we measure the data. So for instance I'm going to play"
"953330","957330"," you some sounds from the accessible oceans project some modification from"
"957330","962670"," the accessible oceans project and the times are measured each hour this is our"
"962670","967490"," data sampling rate so we have like 24 measurements in a day one measurement"
"967490","973950"," each hour. Likewise we don't play the sound continuously but rather we play it"
"973950","982490"," at some data sampling rate where we play each note at an individual moment. So we"
"982490","986990"," have our data measurement rate or a data sampling rate and we have an audio"
"986990","992230"," sampling rate where we play the rate at which we play the sounds. Now the"
"992230","997230"," sampling rate or the frequency at which we measure and then play the"
"997230","1003510"," modification of data is analogous to sound frequency which our ears perceive"
"1003510","1011690"," as pitch. Thus the frequency of the sound playback influences the pitch at which"
"1011690","1017710"," we hear the modification. Often we cannot play the modification of the data with"
"1017710","1022150"," the same frequency as the original data sampling rate because the then the"
"1022150","1026710"," frequency or the pitch we'd be playing would just be outside the audible"
"1026710","1031510"," hearing range for humans. Thus in audification we often have to do"
"1031510","1035589"," something that I've seen called translating or shifting the sound"
"1035589","1040710"," representation of the data how the sampling rate at which we play notes"
"1040710","1045690"," just so that the pitch is in the audible pitch range. Now what I'm going to do is"
"1045690","1050530"," I'm going to play you a sonification of the tides from the accessible oceans"
"1050530","1055830"," project at two different sampling rates. It might be a little bit difficult to"
"1055830","1060850"," hear over the recording like from my computer to your computer but there are"
"1060850","1064370"," two different sampling rates and you can hear that there's a pitch difference"
"1064370","1068750"," between the two. If you can't hear it through the recording I do encourage you"
"1068750","1075570"," to go from the tutorial curriculum page to the accessible oceans page which is"
"1075570","1079870"," linked there and has the examples on it. So if you can't hear the pitch difference"
"1079870","1083330"," here definitely encourage you to go check that out. I'm going to go play that"
"1083330","1085410"," now so it'll be two sonifications."
"1094770","1097250"," All right that was pretty quick so I'm going to play that one more time."
"1100770","1107830"," All right hopefully you could hear the noise happening there. That is the"
"1107830","1114070"," tide cycle you're hearing. So tides go in and out you know every 24 hours that's"
"1114070","1117930"," at least as much as I know about oceanography tells you what I know and"
"1117930","1122430"," so what you're hearing is that actually every 24 samples not that we can hear"
"1122430","1127710"," the individual nodes because they're so close together you hear that as the"
"1127710","1134650"," tides going up and down control the volume of the modification going up and"
"1134650","1141930"," down that each of those cycles is that 24 hour cycle of the tides going up and"
"1141930","1146730"," down. Now I'm going to play this one more time the same modification before I"
"1146730","1150490"," play the next one that's at a different sampling rate so you can hopefully hear"
"1150490","1152990"," the two pitches side-by-side. "
"1162210","1166170"," All right hopefully you can hear that on my end I can definitely hear the pitch"
"1166170","1170730"," difference I'm hoping it comes through on the recording fingers crossed so what"
"1170730","1175310"," you might have been able to tell on those two is first that whoop whoop whoop"
"1175310","1180150"," is still there because we're still measuring that same tide or we're still"
"1180150","1186690"," representing that same tide data of it going up and down the pitch is lower on"
"1186690","1191370"," the second round of data and also it's a little bit slower it's a little bit"
"1191370","1195790"," slower between each whoop whoop whoop and the modification lasts a little bit"
"1195790","1200390"," longer because the data sampling the frequency at which we play those notes"
"1200390","1207410"," is is a little bit slower which lowers that pitch and also lengthens the time of"
"1207410","1211370"," the modification. So again hopefully you could hear that difference and if you"
"1211370","1219050"," couldn't definitely recommend checking it out on your own computer. All right so"
"1219050","1223850"," if modification is so straightforward we're treating the data like a wave and"
"1223850","1229290"," then actually one second before I keep going I think the computer is about to"
"1229290","1233770"," die rather than suffer another technical difficulty which should make"
"1233770","1251870"," me quite sad I'm just going to plug this in sorry folks. All right we're back"
"1251870","1256390"," at business. Okay so if modification is so straightforward where we're really"
"1256390","1261230"," just treating the data like a wave and then representing it as an analogous"
"1261230","1265510"," sound wave why don't we do it for everything? Well there are a lot of"
"1265510","1269850"," reasons. First it's pretty limited and what we can or cannot sonify. For"
"1269850","1275650"," instance how would you audify make an audification or a sonic"
"1275650","1281730"," representation using audification of an image of some 2d data you know with an"
"1281730","1286310"," X and a Y colors there are too many different parameters going on there to"
"1286310","1292650"," put into this amplitude so this volume and then the time. So it's really better"
"1292650","1298510"," suited for a very specific type of data a simpler type of data. Also there might"
"1298510","1303130"," be other reasons we don't want to use audification for instance maybe there's"
"1303130","1308530"," a more like aesthetically pleasing a nicer sound that we can use rather than"
"1308530","1315070"," these amplitude changes in the sound wave. An aesthetic difference is a really"
"1315070","1319330"," valid reason to have a different representation of the data. I mean I can"
"1319330","1322810"," say that I know a lot of scientists that spend a lot of time trying to make"
"1322810","1328370"," their data visualizations look nice look pretty so that matters as a choice too"
"1328370","1334330"," and it's a totally valid choice to make. Again we're not literally showing what"
"1334330","1338590"," the data sounds like we're making choices of how to represent it and"
"1338590","1344570"," depending on our audience and our goals we might make different choices. So let's"
"1344570","1349410"," get into what one of those different choices might be and that might be to"
"1349410","1355570"," use a very popular and very flexible sonification technique called parameter"
"1355570","1361490"," mapping. Parameter mapping is a more flexible as I mentioned form of"
"1361490","1365990"," sonification that has become popular in the recent years and in parameter"
"1365990","1372450"," mapping in essence we map or connect different aspects or dimensions of the"
"1372450","1377570"," data to different parameters of the sound representation such as pitch or"
"1377570","1384490"," volume and rhythm. Like modification we could use parameter mapping to sonify"
"1384490","1389510"," data consisting of say one independent variable that's what I called Y and one"
"1389510","1394190"," dependent variable that's what was time for us here but one of the strengths of"
"1394190","1399850"," parameter mapping is that we can actually map much represent with sound"
"1399850","1407270"," much more complex data than we can with modification because there are many"
"1407270","1412130"," more aspects parameters to the sound that we can use that's pitch and rhythm"
"1412130","1417050"," and volume different instruments and timber I'm not a musician but the list"
"1417050","1420950"," goes on there are a lot of different knobs we can turn in our sound to"
"1420950","1427050"," represent different dimensions different aspects of our data. All right let's"
"1427050","1432010"," clarify the concept of parameter mapping using an example suppose you"
"1432010","1435930"," have measurements of number of sales of something I'm gonna go with ice cream"
"1435930","1439990"," because I like ice cream I can totally go for some right now and net profits from"
"1439990","1446310"," those sales of ice cream over a period of 50 years we choose to map the number"
"1446310","1453630"," of sales to pitch such that more sales are represented by higher pitches and to"
"1453630","1459390"," map net profits to volume such that more profits are represented by a louder"
"1459390","1466630"," note so essentially we let pitch be mapped to sales and volume be"
"1467930","1474210"," mapped to profits from those sales and now we're letting time that independent"
"1474210","1477930"," variable what we'd have along you know the x-axis if this were a visualization"
"1477930","1484830"," for any visualization folks we let time represent be represented by time in the"
"1484830","1489950"," sonification such that each note is a measurement in time so that you know if"
"1489950","1493390"," you're listening later in the sonification you know you're hearing"
"1493390","1498290"," later in time so the first note represents 50 years ago and the last"
"1498290","1504710"," note of the sonification represents the data measured now suppose as we listen"
"1504710","1508550"," to the sonification that we hear a period in which the pitch of notes"
"1508550","1514230"," drops so the pitch goes down we can tell from the mapping decisions that we made"
"1514230","1519310"," that this means the number of ice cream sales in this period has dropped relative"
"1519310","1523830"," to the other measurements perhaps it's wintertime or a recession and people"
"1523830","1528230"," aren't buying as much ice cream now suppose that over the course of the"
"1528230","1533930"," entire data sonification we hear the volume of notes generally increase but"
"1533930","1540170"," the pitch remains relatively constant this means that profits have gone up but"
"1540170","1547570"," the number of sales has gone has remained relatively constant so the cost"
"1547570","1553430"," per ice cream sale the profit per ice cream sale must have gone up that's what"
"1553430","1558710"," I'd call inflation finally suppose that the amount of time between notes"
"1558710","1562690"," decreases towards the end of the sonification this might mean that the"
"1562690","1567990"," data were collected more frequently in later times so that there's less time"
"1567990","1575490"," between each data point note here that there is no one correct way to map our"
"1575490","1580250"," data to different parameters we could just as easily have mapped sales to"
"1580250","1585870"," volume and profits to pitch thus we make choices generally through testing and"
"1585870","1589850"," experimentation to see which representations of our data most"
"1589850","1594490"," effectively and most accurately capture the importance of information and"
"1594490","1599730"," communicate of the information and communicate it preferably in a way"
"1599730","1603850"," that's both understandable comprehensible and aesthetically pleasing"
"1603850","1609930"," this is truly just no different from a data visualization where graphics will go"
"1609930","1614810"," through many iterations of designs to clearly represent the data data"
"1614810","1619950"," representations whether sonic or visual always represent choice so one of the"
"1619950","1623350"," things I hear most often about sonifications is that they're arbitrary"
"1623350","1627810"," is that you know this isn't you know there are so many different ways you"
"1627810","1631030"," could represent the same data how do you ever know anything because that you"
"1631030","1633770"," could just represent the data so many different ways but this is just how"
"1633770","1639250"," representations of data in general go it involves choice it's kind of a fun thing"
"1639250","1646130"," all right let's actually listen to a sonification or to a parameter mapping"
"1646130","1650950"," example now because my background is in astronomy we're going to listen to an"
"1650950","1656470"," astronomy example this is from the NASA and Chandra X-ray Center's universe of"
"1656470","1660210"," sound website and what we're going to do is we're going to listen to the"
"1660210","1669230"," sonification but it also comes with a description which tells us how the"
"1669230","1673690"," break down the parameter mapping so what aspect of the data was mapped to"
"1673690","1679250"," which a parameter of the sound and then we'll listen to the sonification all"
"1682100","1690780"," right it's so we're going to listen to a sonification of the galactic center or"
"1690780","1694140"," of data from the galactic center this was taken from the Chandra X-ray"
"1694140","1701640"," telescope I believe explore the center of our very own Milky Way galaxy the"
"1701640","1706340"," translation begins on the left side of the image and moves to the right with"
"1706340","1711020"," the sounds representing the position and brightness of the sources all right"
"1711020","1715680"," we've already got our first parameter mapping the translation begins on the"
"1715680","1719180"," left side of the image and moves to the right they don't say this directly but"
"1719180","1724780"," what this means is that time within the sonification is mapped to how far we are"
"1724780","1729180"," moving from left to right in the image so you know if you hear in something"
"1729180","1733420"," earlier in the sonification it's closer to the left you hear something right at"
"1733420","1737380"," the end of the sonification later in time you know it's representing"
"1737380","1743500"," something on the right of the image the light of objects located towards the top"
"1743500","1747420"," of the image are heard as higher pitches while the intensity of the light"
"1747420","1753580"," controls the volume all right that's two more parameter mappings there so pitch"
"1753580","1758960"," is controlled by how far we are up and down the image with higher pitches"
"1758960","1764720"," representing objects higher up in the image so closer to the top where lower"
"1764720","1772550"," notes are going to represent objects lower down in the image we also have a"
"1772550","1775790"," second parameter mapping in the sentence the intensity of the light"
"1775790","1780290"," controls the volume what this means is that brighter objects are going to be"
"1780290","1785430"," represented by louder noises and dimmer objects in the image are going to be"
"1785430","1793040"," represented by softer noises stars and compact sources are converted to"
"1793040","1798300"," individual notes while extended clouds of gas and dust produce an evolving"
"1798300","1803480"," drone what does this mean well smaller objects are going to be little notes"
"1803480","1808580"," larger objects longer sounds so the size of the object has to do with the duration"
"1808580","1814620"," of the note the crescendo happens when we reach the bright region to the lower"
"1814620","1820160"," right of the image this is where the 4 million solar mass supermassive black"
"1820160","1825780"," hole at the center of our galaxy known as Sagittarius a star resides and where"
"1825780","1832240"," the clouds of gas and dust are the brightest all right I'm gonna hit play"
"1833400","1834000"," hopefully"
"1901680","1906500"," right I love that sonification that's one of my favorites the universe of"
"1906500","1910360"," sound project has lots of sonification so I definitely recommend checking it"
"1910360","1915220"," out you can get a super long crash course into parameter mapping I think"
"1915220","1919080"," they're lovely really lovely to listen to I'm biased because I like space but"
"1919080","1923260"," there you have it I don't know about you but I think for me the easiest thing to"
"1923260","1926700"," pick out is that note duration thing I could definitely hear those little chimes"
"1926700","1931180"," that are representing stars and then the longer notes especially towards the end"
"1931180","1935720"," where they told us that supermassive black hole is I can hear that sort of"
"1936340","1941440"," longer stretch of notes really lovely I recommend if you want to go and listen"
"1941440","1944740"," to that maybe several more times see if you can hear those individual"
"1944740","1949080"," parameter mappings the pitch representing how high we are along the"
"1949080","1954440"," image up or down the volume representing how bright something is I"
"1954440","1957640"," definitely recommend that I think it also probably would be easier to hear"
"1957640","1962200"," over your own computer again rather than through this recording I'm hoping"
"1962200","1966540"," fingers crossed that the sound records much better here than it did for"
"1966540","1970480"," everyone else sorry if you hear some background noise my guide dog is"
"1970480","1975440"," standing up and shaking but I'm hoping it records much better than it did"
"1975440","1981600"," during the original zoom all right so that is modification and parameter"
"1981600","1985860"," mapping the two I would say most common sonification techniques you will"
"1985860","1990660"," encounter that's also a really quick crash course into what sonification is"
"1990660","1996560"," just keep in mind again sonification is a sound representation of the data now if"
"1996560","2001340"," you're sitting here and thinking Sarah it's super pretty I think it's cool but"
"2001340","2008120"," how in the world do you ever learn to interpret that very understandable and"
"2008120","2012080"," especially it's understandable given that we think of data visualizations"
"2012080","2017340"," graphs and charts and line graphs and so on and so forth as intuitive and easy"
"2017340","2022820"," to interpret but that is not at all true children in schools spend years learning"
"2022820","2027520"," to read graphs in the US where I'm from there's a standardized test for college"
"2027520","2032140"," like to get into university called on the ACT and a whole section of the thing is"
"2032140","2037280"," basically reading graphs and kids study for months for that so clearly we need"
"2037280","2042120"," to learn to read and interpret data visualizations and there are studies"
"2042120","2047980"," suggesting the same should be expected to be true of data sonifications that we"
"2047980","2052480"," should expect to need to learn how to understand and interpret them this kind"
"2052480","2056520"," of makes sense no one's born learning to read a data visualization no one's"
"2056520","2060179"," born learning to understand like already knowing how to understand a data"
"2060179","2066719"," sonification so our goal for the rest of this tutorial recording is going to be to"
"2066719","2073300"," get some basic shapes in Python and then to sonify those different shapes with"
"2073300","2080139"," that astronify package that we just installed in such a way that we can"
"2080139","2084920"," sonify those different shapes and understand how they sound so you can"
"2084920","2089219"," hear this is how a straight line sounds different from a curve which sounds"
"2089219","2093020"," different from something that's moving in sort of a wave like shape the goal"
"2093020","2097320"," here is to develop some intuition for you so things sort of make sense a"
"2097320","2100520"," little bit more on a natural level so that next week when we get into"
"2100520","2104840"," sonifying some more realistic data something that's not just shapes and"
"2104840","2108880"," lines you'll have this intuition or at least the beginning of an intuition"
"2108880","2113780"," already built so that's the goal for the rest of today so now we're going to"
"2113780","2119180"," return to Anaconda prompt or maybe you're already sitting there and I'm"
"2119180","2125520"," going to turn NVDA back on ""speech mode beeps speech mode talk"" and now we can"
"2125520","2134120"," start IPython. So just as we have before I'm going to start IPython by"
"2134120","2144100"," typing I P Y T H O N IPython no spaces and hitting enter. ""Python 3.1 1.5"
"2144100","2150040"," packaged by Anaconda Incorporated Main September.""Alright I'm not gonna let it"
"2150040","2153060"," play that whole thing through because I think you've heard it before but"
"2153060","2155900"," essentially you'll know you're an IPython because it'll tell you your"
"2155900","2161560"," Python version and eventually you'll get to it if you let it finish it'll tell"
"2161560","2168440"," you we're in in one we're in the first input line. Now we're going to start by"
"2168440","2173680"," making some of what I'm going to now refer to as synthetic or simulated data"
"2173680","2178080"," what this basically means is not like real data from like observations or"
"2178080","2182780"," measurements this is basically like fake data we've made to follow various shapes"
"2182780","2187560"," or if you're math savvy and remember like your high school algebra classes"
"2187560","2192300"," we're actually going to just be making some simple algebraic equations here"
"2192300","2197800"," we're not actually going to go through making all of them we're going to go"
"2197800","2201360"," through making several of them so you get the idea of like how this math is"
"2201360","2206160"," going to work and then there's a CSV file that has everything already made"
"2206160","2211420"," that you can load in from the URL I encourage you to go to the curriculum"
"2211420","2216800"," it's under data preparation under the final subheading called just in case"
"2216800","2223620"," quote onquote basically it gives you the CSV file in the URL and just gives you"
"2223620","2230440"," the code to paste it in yes so I encourage you to do that but if you're"
"2230440","2235680"," interested for how exactly all of that synthetic so again all of that not real"
"2235680","2240900"," measured data was made in the CSV file the curriculum goes into painstaking"
"2240900","2245200"," detail about how every column was made and exactly the equations that's going"
"2245200","2249420"," into it so we'll kind of do a brief intro to that just so you have a rough"
"2249420","2254160"," idea of how this CSV was made but if you want all the nitty-gritty details the"
"2254160","2260440"," curriculum has everything all right so those of you who remember algebra"
"2260440","2265460"," classes will remember that like functions equations have two different"
"2265460","2272660"," variables what I've called independent or X and dependent Y so Y is a function of"
"2272660","2279320"," X. Y is going to change when X changes so what I want to do first is I want to"
"2279320","2285940"," make an array of numbers that's going to be our X values so imagine these all of"
"2285940","2292740"," these values so I want for in our case I want 100 values evenly spaced from 0 to"
"2292740","2301740"," 10 so that at each value of X going from 0 to 0.1 0.2 0.3"
"2301740","2307340"," whatever the the even spacing will be will have Y change a different value of"
"2307340","2311820"," Y at each of those values and that Y will change differently depending on what"
"2311820","2317200"," function we do now as was evidenced by the fact that I had to already sit and"
"2317200","2325600"," think about like the first three numbers in those numbers ranging from 0 to 10 I"
"2326920","2333020"," really don't actually want to sit here and write out a list or an array of a"
"2333020","2337440"," hundred numbers evenly spaced from 0 to 10 I hope you don't want to do that"
"2337440","2342000"," either I think we can all agree that that sounds really quite painful so the"
"2342000","2346860"," good news is NumPy has a built-in function that will do this for us so"
"2346860","2350760"," let's get started I'm going to start by importing our favorite packages here so"
"2350760","2362300"," I'm going to do import NumPy import space NumPy and"
"2362300","2369060"," ""N-U-M-P-Y as NP"" it's suggesting the way I always type NumPy but we're not"
"2369060","2373060"," going to do that at the moment into all right and you can hear I hit enter and"
"2373060","2377020"," now it's saying you're on the second line I'm gonna do import pandas ""import"
"2377020","2382260"," NumPy"" it wants to repeat import NumPy we're not going to do that but we're not"
"2382260","2386000"," gonna need pandas at the moment but we will need it very shortly so let's just"
"2386000","2397080"," get it in here ""I-M-P-O-R-T space P-A-N-D-A-S"" import pandas in three whoo good news all"
"2397080","2400880"," set and ready to go so what I've just done is brought the NumPy and pandas"
"2400880","2407940"," packages into this coding session all right and next what we're going to do is"
"2407940","2413180"," we're going to use something called the linspace function the linspace function"
"2413180","2419440"," is a built-in function in NumPy that will basically give us an evenly spaced"
"2419440","2424920"," array of numbers starting at a specified start number and ending at a specified"
"2424920","2430240"," stop number I think this will be easiest to conceptualize if we actually do an"
"2430240","2439120"," example so let's start by doing NumPy so ""N-U-M-P-Y"" so from NumPy so NumPy dot"
"2439120","2450940"," dot NumPy dot linspace that's L-I-N-S-P-A-C-E so basically from the"
"2450940","2458100"," NumPy package pull the linspace function open parenthesis I'm gonna do"
"2458100","2469520"," 0 comma 5 comma 5 close parenthesis. That's NumPy dot linspace"
"2469520","2477520"," open parenthesis 0 comma 5 comma 5 that first 0 that's our start value for the"
"2477520","2484160"," array the second number the 5 is the stop value for our array and then that"
"2484160","2489940"," third number 5 is the number of values I want so basically what I'm saying is"
"2489940","2496280"," linspace give me an array of numbers from 0 to 5 evenly spaced and I want"
"2496280","2500660"," 5 of them and when I hit enter it's going to return to me an array of those"
"2500660","2512860"," numbers ""out 3 array 0 1.25 2.5 3.75 5"" yep there we go"
"2512860","2519360"," and it has spit out an array that goes from 0 to 5 5 numbers evenly spaced"
"2519360","2524360"," let's try this again we can change the parameters let's try NumPy dot linspace"
"2524360","2534700"," ""N-U-M-P-Y"" dot linspace dot ""L-I-N-S-P-A-C-E"" ""open parenthesis ""left paren"" I'm gonna go"
"2534700","2543300"," 0 comma 10 comma 5 what is this saying it's saying our"
"2543300","2551100"," start our start value is 0 our stop value is 10 and I want 5 numbers so NumPy"
"2551100","2557920"," dot linspace open parenthesis 0 comma 10 comma 5 close parenthesis give me 5"
"2557920","2569760"," numbers evenly spaced from 0 to 10 ""out 4 array 0 2.5 5 7.5 10"" and now you can"
"2569760","2574840"," hear we get an array of numbers going all the way up to 10 this time now this"
"2574840","2579400"," is almost what I said I wanted I wanted an array of numbers from 0 to 10 but I"
"2579400","2584900"," wanted a hundred of them so this time we're just going to increase that third"
"2584900","2590380"," value from 5 to a hundred so instead give me a hundred numbers evenly spaced"
"2590380","2594580"," from 0 to 10 and also I don't want the computer to just spit it out at us I"
"2594580","2598500"," actually want to save it so just as Patrick taught us to save variables this"

"2603320","2608240"," dot linspace because I'm gonna say hey make this array of numbers from 0 to 10"

"2666960","2670440"," through the whole thing but as you can hear it's spitting out a rather long"
"2670440","2675500"," array of numbers that are relatively close together and it'll keep going all"
"2675500","2678520"," the way up to 10 a hundred of them we don't want to listen to all of that or"
"2678520","2682020"," at least I don't you're welcome to listen in your own time if you really"
"2682020","2685340"," want to hear all hundred of those numbers but now we have checked that"
"2685340","2690920"," indeed it's saved as X we have an array of numbers evenly spaced from 0 to 10"
"2690920","2696080"," and a hundred of them so rather small spaces now I'm going to do something I'm"
"2696080","2703420"," going to make one of these equations as an example so that you can see how"
"2703420","2709160"," roughly I've made these sort of simple shapes we have going and then we'll load"
"2709160","2714200"," the CSV so that we just have all of the data so what I'm going to do right now"
"2714200","2720100"," is I'm going to make something called a sine function a sine of X so what I mean"
"2720100","2724220"," by this is a sine function is a trig function a trigonometric function"
"2724220","2731300"," basically it's a wave so as X increases Y responds to X by moving up and down in"
"2731300","2737040"," an even wave pattern it just goes up and down at regular intervals as X goes up"
"2737040","2741800"," so essentially what we are doing right now is we are making a wave shape and I"
"2741800","2747680"," just want to call this Y because this is how we often do this in math classes so"
"2747680","2752320"," I'm going to actually I'm going to call it Y underscore sine to specify that we"
"2752320","2757480"," are making a like a sine function it's always good to like name your variables"
"2757480","2761260"," in such a way that you know what they mean because here why if I just call Y"
"2761260","2765660"," it could be like any function if I call Y underscore sine we know it's a sine"
"2765660","2774660"," like a sine wave so we are making a wave right now one Y any line so Y"
"2774660","2781180"," underscore S I N E that's how we spell sine for for you know in math it's not"
"2781180","2789780"," like a sign like a street sign yes. so y_sine"
"2789780","2795660"," ""space equals space"" um and fortunately NumPy so sine is like"
"2795660","2799600"," non easy math thing to do like a multiplication it's something you"
"2799600","2804080"," generally want a calculator for fortunately NumPy has a built-in sine"
"2804080","2808740"," function so all we have to do is do NumPy dot it's actually sin so it's not"
"2808740","2815420"," a full sign it's NumPy dot s i n and that's NumPy's sine function and you"
"2815420","2823880"," ... that was a typo it should be NumPy"
"2823880","2831700"," dot sign not NumPy parenthesis dot s i n left for n right now we want that left"
"2831700","2839520"," for n so Y underscore s i n e equals NumPy dot s i n open parenthesis 2 times"
"2839520","2847920"," X that's going to be ""2 star X right paren"" so we are saying that"
"2847920","2854620"," Y sine is equal to the sine of 2 times X again this is a really powerful thing"
"2854620","2858960"," about NumPy arrays that you can do math with them like this you can multiply them"
"2858960","2862880"," you can take the sine of them all sorts of things like this and we can hit enter"
"2862880","2871600"," and if we print out Y sine now so if I just type Y underscore sine ""Y line s i n"
"2871600","2892540"," e and hit enter out a array 0 0.20064886 0.39313661 0.56963411 0.72296256 0.84688556"
"2892540","2908760"," 0.93636273 0.98775469 0.99897117 0.969555"" sorry to play so many of those numbers for"
"2908760","2913400"," you but I wanted you to hear that it goes up and then back down if I let it play even"
"2913400","2918180"," longer we would have heard it go all the way down below zero and then back up again"
"2918820","2922460"," which I encourage you to do because it'll give you an intuition for what's going on"
"2922460","2926420"," with this function but essentially what I want you to understand is that a sine of X"
"2926420","2931280"," is a wave so it's going to go up and then down and then up again and then down again"
"2932000","2939560"," all right cool let's make maybe one more really quite simple equation here I in fact it's"
"2939560","2943700"," going to be the simplest equation it's going to be a linear equation we're going to make"
"2943700","2951880"," Y equals X which basically means that for every step X makes to get larger Y gets larger"
"2951880","2959480"," by the same amount and I'm going to call this Y underscore linear Y Y line linear Y underscore"
"2959480","2970120"," L I N E A R ""L I N E A R space equals space"" and it's just Y equals X so Y underscore linear"
"2970120","2977040"," equals X and that's basically saying it's like a straight line just slanted upwards"
"2977040","2983940"," every step X gets bigger Y gets bigger by the same amount in 10 and if we output Y underscore"
"2983940","3001060"," linear ""1 L I N E A R out 10 array 0 0.1010101 0.2020202 0.3030"" all right I'm going to stop"
"3001060","3005700"," it there but maybe you remember from when we printed out X that this is exactly the same"
"3005700","3012980"," so basically we've just gone and we've made a an array that makes the exact same that"
"3012980","3018560"," is exactly the same as X so every step X gets bigger Y stays the same amount so it gets"
"3018560","3023000"," bigger by the same amount it is a straight line now again if you go to the curriculum"
"3023000","3028060"," it goes through in absolute detail how to make every single one of the equations that"
"3028060","3032740"," we're going to load into the CSV and so if you're mathematically minded or you just want"
"3032740","3037460"," to learn more about how to do math in Python I definitely encourage you to check that out"
"3037460","3043800"," it covers quadratic equations all sorts of things like that but we're not going to get"
"3043800","3047940"," into all of that right now just because I know it's a little bit tedious and everything's"
"3047940","3053100"," already loaded into a CSV so if you're more on the data analysis side of things you don't"
"3053100","3062720"," want to do all the math then we don't have to get into all of that maybe yeah so I encourage"
"3062720","3067060"," you to check out the curriculum either at this moment to see the rest of the math happen"
"3068140","3073780"," or to load the CSV which I'm about to do I actually with the benefit of hindsight I would"
"3073780","3077040"," love to show you guys how to do a quadratic equation as well just because I want to show"
"3077040","3081540"," you guys how to do an exponent maybe this is the math person in me showing so I'm just"
"3081540","3086980"," going to show you how to do a quadratic really quickly now this isn't actually the exact"
"3086980","3095260"," quadratic that I have in the CSV I've sort of shifted and compressed that a little bit"
"3095260","3100340"," just to make it a nicer shape to listen to and again the curriculum goes into painstaking"
"3100340","3106320"," detail about how exactly that goes but I just want to show you how to do an exponent so"
"3106320","3112360"," a parabola is the shape of a quadratic equation it's basically a curve that goes up up up"
"3112360","3119140"," really steep as you get to the turning point it sort of starts to level out it turns around"
"3119140","3123960"," and then gets steeper and steeper as it goes back down or up again depending on whether"
"3123960","3129740"," or not you flipped it so it's almost like a wave but it's not like the sign because the"
"3129740","3136760"," sign goes up and down repeatedly the parabola is just a curve that turns over once and it's"
"3136760","3142780"," steepest at the sides and flattest at the top and it's the simplest form of a quadratic"
"3143400","3149820"," is y equals x squared I'm going to save this as an equation that or as a variable that I'm"
"3149820","3155540"," going to call y underscore parabola because that is the shape of a quadratic so it's going to be"
"3155540","3171480"," y underscore ""y underscore p a r a b o l a"""
"3171480","3179700"," parabola space equals space x squared and the the main reason that I am taking the time"
"3179700","3186080"," to do this right now even though it's all in that csv is that I want you guys to know how to do"
"3186080","3192800"," exponents in I want to recap how to do exponents in Python just in case because I think it's good"
"3192800","3199700"," to know so I always when I started doing Python expected an exponent to be a caret it is not it"
"3199700","3211020"," is two asterisks so x squared is x asterisk asterisk square two ""x star star two"" so y parabola"
"3211020","3219040"," equals x asterisk asterisk two in 12 and if we print out y parabola just by typing it and hitting"
"3219040","3235860"," enter ""y line p a r a b o l a out 12 array 0.000000000 e plus 00 1.02030405 times"" we"
"3235860","3240360"," had some crazy numbers I don't I don't find that easy to interpret I don't know about you I think"
"3240360","3245640"," they're all in a scientific notation that's what that e means that it's put it you know in the form"
"3245640","3256080"," of so for instance 9e2 would be 9 times 10 to the power of 2 which is 200 not 200 is 100 sorry"
"3256080","3262280"," about that so 9 times 100 or 900 it's what we do for like really large or small numbers in science"
"3262280","3266940"," and Python loves to print things out like that sometimes if it gets a little unwieldy I don't"
"3266940","3270740"," know about you but I find that a little bit difficult to interpret just listening to it"
"3270740","3275680"," scientific notation is a little bit hard to interpret just hearing it or looking at it I"
"3275680","3281960"," would say but the thing to keep in mind again is that a parabola a quadratic equation is that curve"
"3281960","3288700"," shape going up and then down just once and if you want to see the exact way I did this to make it"
"3288700","3294240"," in the CSV then again check out the curriculum it goes into absolute detail about how I made this"
"3294240","3299240"," this CSV so you can have all the nitty-gritty you can know the exact equation I used for everything"
"3299240","3303780"," and again if you're curious about that feel free to stop by office hours or shoot me an email"
"3304380","3310560"," all right I'm going to pop out of um out of ipython and into uh into google chrome"
"3310560","3323260"," ..."
"3323260","3330500"," ..."
"3333020","3339000"," and because I am low vision I am well accustomed to squinting at my computer so you might notice"
"3339000","3345240"," me navigating in a way that is a little bit more sighted than maybe um just fully using NVDA that's"
"3345240","3354500"," also...me not being a full NVDA desktop I usually use mac"
"3354500","3361920"," so one little caveat if you are working from uh the curriculum as it is now there's one little"
"3361920","3366440"," thing we're going to need to do before we copy and paste that little snippet of code again this is"
"3366440","3373800"," under that subheading just in case in the module preparing data for sonification now I have done"
"3373800","3378900"," a little shorthand in this code snippet that in retrospect I shouldn't know so I might go back and"
"3378900","3385460"," fix it but basically I am very accustomed to shortening pandas as pd you'll see people do"
"3385460","3390640"," this a lot it's just because it's shorter to type out than pandas but we have to tell our computers"
"3390640","3396840"," like hey I'm going to call pandas pd from now on so we've already imported pandas but we're actually"
"3396840","3402720"," going to import it again and tell the computer actually from now on I'm going to call it pd"
"3402720","3416840"," so that's just import ""I M P O R T ""import pandas ""space p a n d a s"" as pd space ""a s pd"""
"3419080","3425680"," import pandas as pd so bring in pandas and from now on we're calling it pd again we've already"
"3425680","3430360"," brought in pandas we're into this ipython session but now we need to remind the computer tell the"
"3430360","3434860"," computer hi I'm calling it something different now we only need to do this just because if you"
"3434860","3441700"," copy and paste straight from the code I put in the curriculum I call pandas pd there which"
"3441700","3446640"," was an oversight on my part so I might go back and fix that I probably ought to so I'm going to hit"
"3446640","3452900"," enter importing all right we've imported pandas as pd and now I am just going to paste in that"
"3452900","3461520"," line of code or those three lines of code actually um from uh oh actually there's one other thing we"
"3461520","3466960"," need to cover before we paste in those lines of code and that's going to be uh something called"
"3466960","3475400"," um astropy tables now astronify the sonification package that we are using today is a package that"
"3475400","3480380"," was made by astronomers to be used by astronomers and we'll get into more detail about what exactly"
"3480380","3487620"," it is and how it works in a second but because it was made by astronomers for astronomers um it uses"
"3487620","3495280"," a specific type of data a object type in python that astronomers like to use this is something"
"3495280","3504160"," called an astropy table astropy is astropython basically it is a python package that has a ton"
"3504160","3510200"," of astronomy functionalities things like astronomy units like things like light years and parsecs"
"3510200","3516360"," it also has coordinate system transforms all sorts of things like that are handled within"
"3516360","3522780"," astropy it also has a data type actually there's multiple but in this case it has this uh this type"
"3522780","3529980"," um of object called a table for our purposes here an astropy table is exceptionally similar"
"3530830","3539280"," to an astro uh to um a panda's data frame and in fact they're so similar that astropy has a built"
"3539280","3548020"," in function to uh convert a panda's data frame directly to an astropy table um and the reason"
"3548020","3556820"," we're going to do this is because um the reason we want to do this is because uh um astronify only"
"3556820","3564100"," takes as input astropy tables it really just wants astropy tables because it was made for astronomy"
"3564100","3571260"," data so we have to convert our panda's data frame to an astropy table in order to give it to um"
"3571260","3576880"," in order to give it to astronify to sonify so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to import"
"3577460","3583600"," table from astropy so basically say from this astropy package bring in this table things we"
"3583600","3595680"," need it so i'm going to type from ""f r o m"" so from astropy that space that's ""a s t r o p y"""

"3680820","3686680"," lines in this code the first line that we're going to copy and paste in is url equals that really"
"3686680","3694760"," long url it's basically hey the url is called this save it as this thing called url the second"
"3694760","3704740"," one is a function we've seen before it's df equals pd dot read csv url so it's basically saying"
"3705820","3714500"," make a new data frame called df and then pd remember that's now pandas pandas dot read csv"
"3714500","3722640"," so read the csv at that url after url it's comma index underscore call equals"
"3722640","3730320"," zero that means set the index of our new data frame as the zeroth column and then the third"

"3830900","3841200"," that final line is tbl equals table capital t dot from pandas open parenthesis df close"

"3847700","3854900"," and cross our fingers that it works ""in 16."" all right no error messages read out that means it"
"3854900","3862580"," worked success all right our data is prepared it is in an astropy table let's take a moment"
"3862580","3868440"," to explore this astropy table so first what we're going to do is we're going to print out"
"3868440","3874740"," the column names the way we do this for an astropy table is by doing tbl so that's the"
"3874740","3882380"," name of our table t b l and then we're going to do dot call dot ... it's already trying to"
"3882380","3895520"," suggest it dot c o l n a m e s tbl dot col names so from table take"
"3895520","3902120"," the column names and if we hit enter it'll just print them out ""out 16 x linear n e g linear"
"3902120","3912060"," parabola abs sine in 17.""all right so in this table there are six columns there is x linear"
"3912060","3922380"," neg underscore linear parabola abs and sine these are the x actually the exact same x that we made"
"3922380","3929760"," with that lin space function above and then five other functions of x so variables that are"
"3929760","3936960"," following a function of x linear is that y equals x that we made above so it's just every step that"
"3936960","3943880"," x makes to get bigger y gets bigger by the same amount so it's a straight line going up neg"
"3943880","3951200"," underscore linear is y equals negative x so it's still a straight line except every time that x gets"
"3951200","3959180"," bigger y gets smaller so it's a straight line slanted downwards parabola that's the quadratic"
"3959180","3964560"," equation we were talking about now in this case it's not exactly y equals x squared it's a little"
"3964560","3970480"," bit different um i believe it's something like if i recall correctly i want to say it's let me take a"

"4229100","4236880"," that is all we really need to care about and with that we are going to uh check off that data"
"4236880","4243360"," preparation stage and celebrate because we are about to get into actually sonifying things"
"4243360","4250500"," with one caveat first i want us to talk about what astronify is and how it works"
"4251460","4258760"," all right so astronify is a python package we've installed that is developed by scott"
"4258760","4264460"," fleming at the space telescope science institute clara brosser at space telescope science institute"
"4264460","4269860"," and now at the university of saint andrews um jen kotler at space telescope and kate meredith"
"4269860","4276760"," at glass education and it is a package designed to sonify or represent a sound a very specific"
"4276760","4283540"," type of astronomical data called a light curve light curves represent the observed amount of"
"4283540","4290540"," light from an object typically a star as we see it on earth so it observe it measures the amount"
"4290540","4297240"," of light we see um generally from a telescope so how much light we are collecting from a telescope"
"4297880","4304160"," from a specific star over time astronomers like to call that observed amount of light how much"
"4304160","4309400"," light we receive from an object here on earth we like to call that flux so we are observing the"
"4309400","4316520"," flux the amount of light seen from a star over time thus light curves allow astronomers to"
"4316520","4321860"," observe variability in the amount of light a telescope records coming from a star or to"
"4321860","4328960"," record how bright a star basically appears to us on earth observing this variability can give"
"4329260","4335600"," insight into all sorts of incredible phenomena including explosive stellar activity called flares"
"4335600","4342860"," so that would be a sudden increase in brightness at a period of time and small periodic dips in"
"4342860","4348120"," the amount of light observed from a star caused by a planet orbiting that star and blocking some"
"4348120","4353820"," of its light as it passes through our line of sight and orbits the star um as it passes through"
"4353820","4359200"," our line of sight with the star we call this latter phenomenon a an exoplanet transit and"
"4359200","4364560"," we've used it to discover thousands of planets outside our solar system orbiting other stars"
"4364560","4369060"," what's essentially happening is that at regular intervals as the planet orbits the star"
"4369060","4375220"," it gets in between our telescope and the star and blocks a tiny fraction of the light and it does"
"4375220","4380480"," that over and over and over again so you know if you see a star that looks like it's getting dimmer"
"4380480","4385840"," by a tiny regular amount at regular intervals you can be like there might be a planet getting"
"4385840","4393000"," in the way there and boom you found a planet. Astronify works by mapping the observed flux"
"4393000","4399160"," again remember that's the observed amount of light we see from the star that's our dependent"
"4399160","4406600"," variable that's changing with time to pitch such that higher fluxes are represented by higher"
"4406600","4412960"," pitches so if you have a moment where you observe more light that data is going to be represented by"
"4412960","4419400"," a higher pitch each observation of the star's brightness is thus represented by a note where"
"4419400","4425540"," the pitch is controlled by the value of that observation it is worth noting here that although"
"4425540","4431340"," it's the default to have brighter like higher fluxes brighter moments brighter data points"
"4431340","4437760"," mapped to higher pitches the user can set a parameter within Astronify to invert the pitches"
"4437760","4443920"," such that higher fluxes more light are mapped to lower pitches there might be you know personal"
"4443920","4449480"," preference reasons you might do that. We might get into discussing parameters involved in Astronify"
"4449480","4454520"," sonifications next week and this will hopefully make some more sense with some more examples"
"4454520","4460780"," so I'm going to once again going to turn off NVDA's speech mode so it doesn't talk over the"
"4460780","4468320"," sonifications speech mode off speech mode beeps nope I don't want it on speech mode off all right"
"4468320","4474500"," and I'm going to go to Astronify's example this is straight from their web page I highly recommend"
"4474500","4479480"," that you check out Astronify's web page it's again linked on the curriculum um it's a really"
"4479480","4484500"," incredible project I think it's great so I highly recommend you check it out and I'm going to play"
"4484500","4489120"," something this is a sonification of a light curve containing a stellar flare"
"4499520","4503240"," did you hear that I'm going to play that one more time"
"4508100","4508760"," so"
"4514030","4520640"," the sound stays relatively constant until boom there's this moment of where it gets"
"4520640","4527020"," way higher pitched and we know from the mapping we've just discussed that that higher pitch"
"4527490","4532340"," is representing a moment where the star gets a lot brighter as we see it and that's the flare"
"4532340","4539080"," a flare of light and activity from the star that we can really clearly hear as a change in the pitch"
"4539080","4546320"," of the sound representation of the data all right cool now as a concept check"
"4546320","4550780"," moving uh thinking back to our discussion of modification and parameter mapping"
"4550780","4557680"," do you think that Astronify is parameter mapping or modification I'll wait for a second"
"4561480","4565600"," it's awkward to like wait and and give you a chance to think about it when there's like no"
"4565600","4570880"," one on like a zoom call with me or anything I'm just sort of like yes I sit in uh I sit in silence"
"4570880","4576960"," and I uh I let people hopefully online think about it okay that's probably enough time um so"
"4577720","4584780"," Astronify is parameter mapping because in this case the flux or how high y goes up or down"
"4584780","4591020"," our independent or our dependent variable it goes up or down is mapped to pitch so it's not"
"4591020","4595340"," controlling the amplitude of the sound wave which remember we perceive generally as volume"
"4595340","4602300"," it's controlling the pitch so that is a parameter mapping where we have mapped the flux to the"
"4602300","4611060"," parameter pitch in our sonification all right now here we've discussed Astronify within the context"
"4611060","4618220"," of its intended use sonifying light curves however light curves are just the type of 1d data or what"
"4618220","4625640"," I would call 1d data in astronomy so we have two variables time and flux x and y I suppose"
"4625640","4630880"," mathematicians might tell me that they're actually two dimensions 2d because it's time and flux those"
"4630880","4635780"," are two dimensions I'm going to call it 1d variable um hopefully there are no mathematicians who are"
"4635780","4642140"," going to like hunt me down for this but there are all kinds of 1d data out there including maybe"
"4642140","4649560"," some data that you've uh you've dealt with before so we can realistically present other 1d data"
"4649560","4656680"," using Astronify beyond just light curves but before we get to all that complicated stuff"
"4656680","4662520"," let's go back to that sonification education point we were getting back before and this was"
"4662520","4667100"," inspired by a talk that Scott Fleming one of the developers of Astronify gave at the Space"
"4667100","4671220"," Telescope Science Institute's Day of Accessibility wherein he talked about"
"4672120","4678940"," about sonification education and gave some examples where we sonify um where we where he"
"4678940","4684460"," sonified with Astronify some of these simple shapes very similar to what we're about to do"
"4685280","4691400"," so now we're going to make our own sonifications you're going to get a sense for what Astronify"
"4691400","4696760"," does all right I'm going to turn my volume down a little bit so I don't blast our ears out with uh"
"4696760","4703800"," with NVDA ""speech mode speech mode talk"" I'm going to turn the volume up uh I'm going to turn the"
"4703800","4707720"," volume up hopefully not too much hopefully that's a reasonable amount of volume we'll hope for the"
"4707720","4716140"," best okay we've installed Astronify but we haven't imported it into this Python session so what I'm"
"4716140","4729120"," going to do is I'm going to write from ""F-R-O-M"" from Astronify that's ""A-S-T-R-O-N-I-F-Y.series"""
"4729680","4733580"," it wants to finish for me but I've like finished the sentence or finished the line for me but I'm"
"4733580","4747440"," not gonna let it from Astronify A-S-T-R-O-N-I-F-Y dot series ""dot s-e-r-i-e-s"" so from the subsection"
"4747440","4756140"," of Astronify series import so space ""space i-m-p-o-r-t"" import and we're going to import"

"4801880","4806280"," all right so I just let it play some of a warning that came out I think a lot of people have been"
"4806280","4809740"," getting this warning I've been getting this warning I think Patrick did as well I heard"
"4809740","4814520"," from some other people from the live class that they got this warning nothing to worry about it's"
"4814520","4820480"," just like a little warning maybe bad advice but I often ignore warnings if it's not an actual error"
"4820480","4825100"," message so maybe don't take that to heart but I just wanted you to hear it so that if you hear"
"4825100","4830020"," it on your computer you don't worry it's no biggie and now we're going to get started with"
"4830020","4836840"," the sonification now this is going to involve inherently some kind of repetitive four lines"
"4836840","4843440"," of code I'm going to go through the first time or two relatively slowly but then I encourage you"
"4843440","4849040"," and then I'm going to get faster just to you know so we don't take too much time it's again all of"
"4849040","4854380"," these lines of code are on the online curriculum so if you get lost if I start moving too quickly"
"4854380","4858340"," at some point just go and copy and paste it because it's all a little bit repetitive it's"
"4858340","4863720"," like the same thing with like one word changed so there's no shame in like copying and pasting as"
"4863720","4871780"," long as you understand what's going on and couldn't do it yourself afterwards but most programmers"
"4871780","4878800"," copy and paste so what we're going to do first is make an instance of a soni series so the sauna"
"4878800","4884460"," series is a class we're going to make a soni series object I'm going to call it soni underscore"

"4896820","4904080"," do equals space equals and I'm going to do um and the reason I'm calling it soni linear is because"
"4904080","4909440"," this is going to be the sonification object the sauny series object for a linear equation so"
"4909440","4920340"," remember that's our straight line going up ""space s o n i s e r i e s"" remember that's"
"4920340","4927100"," all one word with the s in soni and the s in series both capitalized then open parenthesis"
"4928320","4936920"," tbl so make a soni series object from our table which we've called tbl now there are"
"4936920","4942620"," two extra things we need to do here in this function and that is we need to say hey astronify"
"4942620","4948980"," I know you're made for astronomers sonifying light curves but um actually so I know that you expect"
"4948980","4954980"," these time columns and value columns to be like time and flux but actually we don't have time"

"5058830","5063270"," is something I've played around with already um and a choice that I've made again remember how"
"5063270","5068930"," data representations involve a lot of choice I'm increasing the note spacing here from the default"
"5068930","5073650"," just so it's a little bit slower and easier to hear so the way we're going to do it is we're"

"5245530","5249010"," this sort of wobble that's just because there's like a little bit of a spacing"
