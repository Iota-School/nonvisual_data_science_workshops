	Dear Nonvisual Data Science Workshop Series participant,
      </p>

      <p>
	We're looking forward to working with you at the Nonvisual Data Science workshop this coming Tuesday! This email contains a few updates about next week's workshop. For other information on the workshops, including installation information, please check your inbox for the full welcome email.

	    For your convenience, here is the Zoom link for all five workshops.

	<h2 id="orgheadline2">Workshop Updates</h2>
	<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
	  <p>
	    This workshop series has received a larger than anticipated number of registrations. We're excited that so many are interested in learning nonvisual approaches to data science, and rather than cap registration, we've made a few changes to the workshops.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    First, there will be a number of helpers available in the Zoom chat. If you're having trouble, have a question, or otherwise need help during the workshops, drop your question in the chat and a helper will respond to you. You can also message helpers privately. Please be patient with our helpers, they may take a moment to respond to you as they work with other participants. We will have some limited time for questions on mic, but our apologies in advance if we can't answer your question on voice channels during the workshop.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Second, we will be holding office hours on Thursday, February 8th for two hours starting at 1 PM EST, 6 PM GMT. If you have issues or questions that are not resolved during the workshop, or if you have questions after viewing the recording, please drop in to the office hours to receive additional help and support. The office hours will use the same Zoom link as the workshops. We will send out a reminder about the office hours after the workshop on Tuesday.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally, we will be providing some written materials, accessible with HTML, as well as the recording of the workshop after each session. If you're feeling overwhelmed, remember that you can review these materials later, ask questions in office hours, or email me or Sarah Kane after the session. We know that learning technical skills can be overwhelming and challenging, but we'll do our best to support you.

	<h2 id="orgheadline3">Microphone Policy</h2>
	<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
	  <p>
	    Since we anticipate a large number of participants, we ask you to keep your microphone muted during the session unless you are invited to ask a question. At any time, you can type a question into the chat and our helpers will respond. You can also have your questions answered over microphone during office hours on Thursday.
